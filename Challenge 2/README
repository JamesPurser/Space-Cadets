This is an interpreter for the BareBones programming language, I have made some basic assumptions, as listed below, on the syntax and structure of the language.

1. All lines must end in a semicolon.
2. All variables bust be integers.
3. All integers must be greater then 0.
4. All while loops run until a specific number is reached by a specificed variables.

There is a sample code provided that has the function of multiplying two numbers together, this was provided by the university to test the efficacy of the program.
