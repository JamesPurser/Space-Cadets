This is an interpreter for my extended version of the BareBones programming language, the syntax and functions are set out below.

1. All lines must end in a semicolon.
2. Variables are either integers or strings.
3. Basic operators are added (+, -, *, /)
4. All while loops run until a specific number is reached by a specificed variables.
5. Variables are explicitly defined.

There is a sample code provided that has the function of multiplying two numbers together.
